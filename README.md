# Windows-Python-Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for Windows, derived from the TCM Python 201 course. I've successfully modified the code, making it functional. The scripts cover Remote DDL injection, Process Creation and Shellcode Execution, Keylogger, and Encrypt Blind Shell. It was an enjoyable experience, and I've learned some new concepts along the way.

I have included a screenshot of the scripts in action.
